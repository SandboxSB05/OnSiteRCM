# Payment Verification Implementation

## Overview
Implemented payment verification system to restrict app access to users who have verified their payment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`api/database/schema.sql`)
- ✅ Added `payment_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` column to the `users` table
- Users will have this set to `false` by default
- Only users with `payment_verified = true` can access the app

### 2. Type Definitions (`src/services/authService.ts`)
- ✅ Updated `User` interface to include `payment_verified?: boolean`
- ✅ Updated `AuthResponse` interface to include `payment_verified?: boolean`
- Ensures type safety across the application

### 3. Authentication Service (`src/services/authService.ts`)
Updated all user-fetching functions to include `payment_verified`:
- ✅ `login()` - Includes payment_verified in returned user data
- ✅ `register()` - Includes payment_verified in returned user data
- ✅ `verifySession()` - Includes payment_verified in returned user data
- ✅ `getCurrentUser()` - Includes payment_verified in returned user data

### 4. Protected Route Component (`src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- ✅ Added payment verification check
- Users without `payment_verified = true` are redirected to `/payment-required`
- Check happens after authentication but before route access

### 5. Payment Required Page (`src/pages/PaymentRequired.tsx`)
- ✅ Created new page shown to unverified users
- Features:
  - Clear messaging about payment verification requirement
  - User account information display
  - Contact support button (opens email to support)
  - Logout button
  - Professional, user-friendly design

### 6. Router Configuration (`src/pages/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Added PaymentRequired import
- ✅ Added `/payment-required` to public routes list
- ✅ Added route for PaymentRequired component

## How It Works

1. **User Login Flow:**
   - User logs in successfully
   - Auth service fetches user data including `payment_verified` field
   - User is authenticated and stored in context

2. **Route Protection:**
   - User tries to access protected route
   - `ProtectedRoute` component checks authentication
   - If authenticated but `payment_verified = false`, redirect to `/payment-required`
   - If `payment_verified = true`, allow access to app

3. **Payment Required Page:**
   - Shows user information
   - Provides clear instructions
   - Offers contact support option
   - Allows user to logout

## Database Migration

To apply this to existing database, run:

\`\`\`sql
ALTER TABLE public.users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
\`\`\`

## Setting Users as Verified

To manually verify a user's payment:

\`\`\`sql
UPDATE public.users 
SET payment_verified = true 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
\`\`\`

Or via Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Table Editor
2. Select `users` table
3. Find the user
4. Set `payment_verified` to `true`

## Testing

1. **Test with unverified user:**
   - Create new user (payment_verified defaults to false)
   - Login
   - Should be redirected to `/payment-required`
   - Should not be able to access any protected routes

2. **Test with verified user:**
   - Set user's `payment_verified` to true in database
   - Login
   - Should have full access to all routes based on role

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for payment verification system:
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Subscription plans and pricing tiers
- Trial period support
- Payment verification webhook handling
- Admin panel to manage user payment status
- Email notifications for payment status changes
