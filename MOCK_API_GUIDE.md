# MOCK API - Development Guide

## What Was Done

All Base44 dependencies have been removed and replaced with **detailed mock implementations** that:

1. ✅ **Log every API call** with colored console output showing:

   - What endpoint would be called
   - What data is being sent/requested
   - What your backend needs to do
   - What's being returned

2. ✅ **Persist data in localStorage** so you can:

   - Create projects, updates, users during development
   - Data survives page refreshes
   - Acts like a real database (in your browser)

3. ✅ **Preserve all functionality** - Your entire app works, just without a real backend

## How to Use This

### 1. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and **open your browser's Developer Console** (F12)

### 2. Watch the Console

Every time you interact with the app, you'll see detailed logs like:

```
[API CALL] Project.list()
  → HTTP: GET /api/projects?sort=-created_date&limit=20
  → Expected backend action: Fetch all records, sort by created_date descending, limit to 20
  ← Returning 5 records
```

### 3. Build Your Backend

Read **`BACKEND_API_SPEC.md`** - it contains:

- Every endpoint you need to implement
- Request/response formats
- Data models
- When each endpoint is called
- Implementation notes

### 4. Replace Mock APIs

Once your backend is ready:

1. Update `src/api/base44Client.js`:

   ```javascript
   const API_BASE_URL = "https://your-backend.com/api";
   ```

2. Replace the mock methods in `src/api/entities.js` with real HTTP calls using fetch/axios

3. Replace integrations in `src/api/integrations.js` with your real services

## Files Created/Modified

### Core API Files

- **`src/api/base44Client.js`** - Mock HTTP client
- **`src/api/entities.js`** - Mock database entities (Project, User, DailyUpdate, etc.)
- **`src/api/integrations.js`** - Mock integrations (Email, AI, File Upload)

### Documentation

- **`BACKEND_API_SPEC.md`** - Complete API specification (READ THIS!)
- **`MOCK_API_GUIDE.md`** - This file

### Modified

- **`package.json`** - Removed @base44/sdk dependency
- **`index.html`** - Updated branding

## Current Mock Data

The app starts with:

- 1 Demo Admin user (auto-logged in)
- 1 Demo regular user
- 1 Sample project (if you create more, they're saved in localStorage)

## Console Output Examples

### Creating a Project

```
[API CALL] Project.create()
  → HTTP: POST /api/projects
  → Data to save: {project_name: "New Roof", address: "123 Main St", ...}
  → Expected backend action: INSERT new record into database
  ← Created record with ID: 1701234567890abc
```

### Sending an Email

```
[API CALL] SendEmail()
  → HTTP: POST /api/integrations/email/send
  → Email details: {to: "customer@example.com", subject: "Daily Update", ...}
  → Expected backend action:
    1. Validate email addresses
    2. Format email with template
    3. Send via SMTP/SendGrid/AWS SES/etc
    4. Handle bounces and track delivery
    5. Log email for audit trail
  ← Email "sent" with ID: mock-1701234567890-xyz
  ⚠️  WARNING: This is a MOCK - no actual email was sent!
```

## Testing Features

Everything works in development mode:

- ✅ Create/edit/delete projects
- ✅ Add daily updates
- ✅ Upload photos (stored as blob URLs locally)
- ✅ Send "emails" (logged to console)
- ✅ Generate AI summaries (mock responses)
- ✅ User management
- ✅ Analytics views

**Important:** Data is stored in localStorage, so:

- Clearing browser data = losing your test data
- Different browsers = different data sets
- Incognito mode = fresh data each time

## Next Steps

1. **Review BACKEND_API_SPEC.md** - Understand what APIs you need
2. **Plan your backend** - Choose technology stack
3. **Set up database** - Create tables for User, Project, DailyUpdate, etc.
4. **Implement endpoints** - Start with authentication, then CRUD operations
5. **Connect frontend** - Update API_BASE_URL and replace mock functions
6. **Deploy** - Host backend and update frontend to use production URL

## Questions?

The mock implementation mirrors what Base44 was providing. Every console log shows you:

- What HTTP call would be made
- What data is being sent/received
- What your backend needs to implement

Watch the console as you click around the app - it's your guide to building the backend!
