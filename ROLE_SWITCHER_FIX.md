# Role Switcher Fix - Implementation Details

## Problem Identified

The role switcher button wasn't working because:

1. **localStorage was updated** ✅ (this part worked)
2. **AuthContext wasn't re-reading the updated user** ❌ (this was broken)
3. **Page reload was forcing re-authentication** which failed because there's no real API

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Added:**

- `setUser` function exposed in the context
- Fallback to localStorage when API verification fails

**Changes:**

```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
  refreshUser: () => Promise<void>;
  setUser: (user: User | null) => void; // ← NEW
}

const refreshUser = async () => {
  try {
    const verifiedUser = await verifySession();
    setUser(verifiedUser);
  } catch (error) {
    // If API fails, try to get from localStorage (for dev mode)
    const storedUser = getCurrentUser(); // ← FALLBACK
    setUser(storedUser);
  }
};
```

### 2. Updated Layout (`src/pages/Layout.tsx`)

**Changed:**

- Use `setUser` directly instead of `refreshUser`
- Use React Router `navigate` instead of `window.location.href`
- Removed forced page reload

**Before:**

```typescript
const { user, logout: authLogout, refreshUser } = useAuth();

const handleRoleSwitch = () => {
  // ... role switching logic
  setCurrentUser(updatedUser);
  await refreshUser(); // ← Tried API call (failed)
  window.location.href = "/Dashboard"; // ← Forced reload
};
```

**After:**

```typescript
const { user, logout: authLogout, setUser } = useAuth();

const handleRoleSwitch = () => {
  // ... role switching logic
  setCurrentUser(updatedUser);
  setUser(updatedUser); // ← Direct state update
  navigate("/Dashboard"); // ← SPA navigation
};
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "Switch Role" button**
2. **Calculate next role** (admin → user → client → admin)
3. **Update localStorage** with new role
4. **Update AuthContext state** directly via `setUser()`
5. **Navigate to appropriate page** (client → MyProjects, others → Dashboard)
6. **Navigation items update** automatically because they depend on `user.role`

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Instant updates** - No page reload needed  
✅ **Works without API** - Perfect for dev mode  
✅ **Preserves app state** - No loss of data or UI state  
✅ **Smooth transitions** - Uses React Router for navigation  
✅ **Context updates immediately** - All components see the new role instantly

## Testing

### Test Steps:

1. Go to home page
2. Click "DEV: Skip to App" (logs in as Admin)
3. Click "Switch Role" in sidebar
4. Should switch to Contractor → navigation updates
5. Click "Switch Role" again
6. Should switch to Homeowner → redirects to MyProjects
7. Click "Switch Role" again
8. Should switch back to Admin → redirects to Dashboard

### Expected Behavior:

- Navigation items change immediately
- User badge shows correct role
- Page navigation works smoothly
- No errors in console
- Toast notification appears on each switch

## Files Modified

1. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**

   - Added `setUser` to interface
   - Exposed `setUser` in context value
   - Added localStorage fallback in `refreshUser`

2. **`src/pages/Layout.tsx`**
   - Changed from `refreshUser` to `setUser`
   - Changed from `window.location.href` to `navigate()`
   - Removed async from `handleRoleSwitch`

## Production Notes

⚠️ **This is DEV ONLY functionality**

Before production deployment:

- Remove the role switcher button entirely
- Remove the dev bypass button from home page
- Implement proper role assignment through backend API
- Users should not be able to change their own roles

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Tested:** Pending user verification
