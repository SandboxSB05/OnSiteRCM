# ✅ Role-Based Access Control - FIXED

## Problem
Previously, ALL authenticated users could access ANY page by typing the URL directly. There was no role-based restriction - only authentication checking.

## Solution Implemented
Added `allowedRoles` prop to all `ProtectedRoute` components to enforce role-based access control.

## Changes Made

### Updated Routes (`src/pages/index.tsx`)

**Admin Only Pages:**
- `/Users` - Only admins can manage users

**Admin & Contractor Pages:**
- `/Dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/Projects` - Project management
- `/DailyUpdates` - Daily updates
- `/Analytics` - Analytics dashboard
- `/CustomerPortal` - Customer management
- `/Project` - Individual project view
- `/ClientUpdates` - Client update management

**All Users (Admin, Contractor, Client):**
- `/MyProjects` - View assigned projects
- `/MyAnalytics` - Personal analytics
- `/ClientUpdateDetail` - View update details

## How It Works Now

### Before (Insecure):
```tsx
<Route path="/Users" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>  {/* ❌ Any logged-in user could access */}
    <Users />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### After (Secure):
```tsx
<Route path="/Users" element={
  <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['admin']}>  {/* ✅ Only admins */}
    <Users />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

## Security Layers

1. **Authentication** - User must be logged in
2. **Payment Verification** - User must have `payment_verified = true`
3. **Role Authorization** - User's role must be in `allowedRoles` array
4. **Automatic Redirect** - Unauthorized users are redirected to their home page

## Test Cases

### ✅ Client attempting to access `/Dashboard`:
- Authentication: ✅ Pass
- Payment: ✅ Pass
- Role Check: ❌ Fail (client not in ['admin', 'contractor'])
- **Result:** Redirected to `/MyProjects`

### ✅ Contractor attempting to access `/Users`:
- Authentication: ✅ Pass
- Payment: ✅ Pass
- Role Check: ❌ Fail (contractor not in ['admin'])
- **Result:** Redirected to `/Dashboard`

### ✅ Admin accessing any page:
- Authentication: ✅ Pass
- Payment: ✅ Pass
- Role Check: ✅ Pass (admin is allowed everywhere)
- **Result:** Access granted

## Status
🔒 **All pages are now properly protected by role-based access control**
