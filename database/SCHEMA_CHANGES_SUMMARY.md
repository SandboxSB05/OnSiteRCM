# Database Schema Standardization - Summary

## What Was Done

I've standardized your database schema and updated the hardcoded mock data to match. This makes it easy to implement the real database without breaking changes.

## Files Created/Modified

### ✅ Created Files

1. **`database/schema.sql`** - Complete PostgreSQL/Supabase schema
2. **`database/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed migration and implementation guide

### ✅ Modified Files

1. **`src/types/entities.types.ts`** - Updated Project interface with standardized fields
2. **`src/api/entities.ts`** - Updated mock data to use new field structure

## Key Changes

### Projects Table Schema

#### Address Structure (CHANGED)

**Before:** Single `address` field

```typescript
address: "123 Main St, Anytown USA";
```

**After:** Structured address fields

```typescript
address_line1: "123 Main St"
address_line2?: "Apt 4B"  // Optional
city: "Anytown"
state: "TX"
zip_code: "78701"  // Optional
```

#### Budget Field (RENAMED)

**Before:** `project_budget`
**After:** `estimated_budget`

#### Date Fields (ENHANCED)

**Before:**

- `start_date` (single date)

**After:**

- `estimated_start_date` (when you plan to start)
- `actual_start_date` (when you actually started)
- `estimated_end_date` (planned completion)
- `actual_completion_date` (actual completion)

#### New Required Fields

- ✨ `project_type` - residential_replacement, commercial_repair, etc.
- ✨ `client_name` - Now required (was optional)
- ✨ `city` - Required for structured address
- ✨ `state` - Required for structured address

#### New Optional Fields

- ✨ `client_phone` - Phone number
- ✨ `square_footage` - Project size
- ✨ `project_manager` - Name of PM

## Database Schema Highlights

### Tables Included

1. ✅ users
2. ✅ projects (standardized)
3. ✅ daily_updates
4. ✅ client_updates
5. ✅ project_collaborators
6. ✅ costs
7. ✅ project_contacts

9. ✅ update_threads

### Features

- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ Auto-updating timestamps
- ✅ Cascade deletes where appropriate

## Mock Data Updated

All 3 sample projects now include:

```typescript
{
  project_name: "Sample Residential Roof - Smith House",
  project_type: "residential_replacement",
  project_status: "in_progress",
  client_name: "John Smith",
  client_email: "john@example.com",
  client_phone: "(555) 123-4567",
  address_line1: "123 Main St",
  city: "Anytown",
  state: "TX",
  zip_code: "78701",
  estimated_budget: 15000,
  square_footage: 2400,
  estimated_start_date: "2025-10-08",
  actual_start_date: "2025-10-08",
  estimated_end_date: "2025-10-22",
  project_manager: "Mike Johnson",
  owner_user_id: "1"
}
```

## What You Need to Do Next

### Frontend Components (Not Yet Updated)

These components still reference old field names and need updates:

1. **`src/components/projects/ProjectForm.tsx`**

   - Split address input into separate fields
   - Add project_type selector
   - Rename estimated_subtotal → estimated_budget
   - Add client_phone field

2. **`src/components/projects/ProjectGrid.tsx`**

   - Update address display to concatenate structured fields
   - Change project_budget → estimated_budget

3. **`src/pages/Projects.tsx`** & **`src/pages/MyProjects.tsx`**

   - Update search/filter to handle structured addresses
   - Update type definitions

4. **`src/components/projects/details/ProjectHeader.tsx`**

   - Update address display

5. **`src/pages/Analytics.tsx`** & **`src/components/analytics/PerformanceVariance.tsx`**

   - Change project_budget → estimated_budget
   - Update date field references

6. **`src/pages/CustomerPortal.tsx`**
   - Update customer aggregation logic for new fields

## Testing Your Changes

Run the dev server to see if the mock data works:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see 3 sample projects with all the new fields populated.

## Database Implementation

When you're ready to implement the real database:

1. **Apply the schema:**

   ```bash
   psql -U username -d database -f database/schema.sql
   # OR with Supabase:
   supabase db reset
   ```

2. **Set up RLS policies** (examples in MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

3. **Update supabaseEntities.ts** to use the new field names

4. **Test the API endpoints** with the standardized fields

## Benefits of This Structure

✅ **Better Data Integrity** - Structured addresses, required fields, type checking
✅ **Easier Filtering** - Can filter by city, state, project type
✅ **Better UX** - Separate address fields are easier to fill out
✅ **Mapping Ready** - Structured addresses work with mapping APIs
✅ **Analytics Ready** - Can aggregate by location, type, budget ranges
✅ **Clear Dates** - Distinguish between estimated and actual dates
✅ **Scalable** - Schema supports growth with indexes and relationships
